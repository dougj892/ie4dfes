# Bayesian methods for decision-focused evaluations

This repo contains supplementary code for the IDinsight working paper "insert final title". We have also included instructions on how to run Stan and Rstudio on AWS for those out there who, like us, find it extremely difficult to get Stan working on our personal laptops

## Getting started
Prior to running this code, you first need to install R and RStan. Instructions for installing RStan can be found here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started. If you find it difficult to install RStan on your personal laptop, we have created an AWS AMI which others can use to (relatively) quickly run Stan in the cloud.  

Once you haver a version R and RStan running, either on your personal laptop or in the cloud, simply run the R scripts.  


## Setting up R and Stan in the cloud
TBD -- include instructions on how to use our AMI here.
